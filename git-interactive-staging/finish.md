In this scenario we have seen that staging multiple files with `git add` by listing them on the command line is tedious. We learned a better way to stage multiple files by using `git add --interactive` to open an interactive prompt that allows us to select files to stage much more easily. We also learned that the same `git add --interactive` command can be used to stage untracked files too.

In the next scenario we will learn another, much more powerful use of `git add --interactive`; staging only parts of a file for commit, known as `patching`.
